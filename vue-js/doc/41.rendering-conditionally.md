## v-if directives
It is most prefered to render items based on conditions. this can also be done with css.
But the most preferred way is using the v-if directories
```html
    <section id="user-goals">
      <h2>My course goals</h2>
      <input type="text" v-model="goalItem"  @keydown.enter="updateUserGoals"/>
      <button>Add Goal</button>
<!--      <p :style="{display:showEmpty?'block':'none'}" v-if="goals.length<0">No goals have been added yet - please start adding some!</p>-->
      <p   v-if="goals.length<=0">No goals have been added yet - please start adding some!</p>
      <ul>
        <li v-for="goal  in goals"   v-if="goals.length>0">{{ goal }}</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
```

We can render components of the web with v-if  directives.
The most dynamic way to work with these are the v-else and the v-else-if combinations to render components that comes right after each other. 

```html
 <section id="user-goals">
      <h2>My course goals</h2>
      <input type="text" v-model="goalItem"  @keydown.enter="updateUserGoals"/>
      <button>Add Goal</button> 
      <p   v-if="goals.length<=0">No goals have been added yet - please start adding some!</p>
      <ul v-else-if="goal.length>1">
        <li v-for="goal  in goals"   >{{ goal }}</li>
      </ul>
     <span v-else>....</span>
    </section>
```

### v-if directives
Actually removes or adds an element to the page.

### v-show directive
which is a standalone directive is used to change the display to gone or block. It does not remove the element from the dom.
But only keeps it hidden or shown. 

Adding and removing elements can cause performance. Use v-show if u have elements who's view toggles show or hidden alot. 

### Event Propagation on the list item from the parent list.
