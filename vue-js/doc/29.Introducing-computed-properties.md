## Computed Properties

are essentially like methods. 
with one important different. Vue would be aware of their dependencies and only re-execute them if of its properties changes.

NB:
Computer properties are executed without parenthesis. And they are executed only once.

```html
  <button @click="resetInputs">Reset</button>

      <p>Result: {{ counter }} & Name is {{fullname}}</p>

```
By conversion computed properties methods are named just like the data `name`
```javascript
computed: {
    fullname(){
      return this.name+' '+ 'Fas';
    }

  }
```
we use them like variables.
