### Working With Watchers

Is a function you can tell vue to execute when one of its dependencies changes.(like computed properties).

Watch is executed anytime a specific variable in the data set is changed. it can be used to observe
changes in the data variables.
```javascript
 watch:{
    name(){
      this.fullname=this.name+'  '+ 'Watching'
    }
  }

```
A watcher gets the latest property of the variable and we can just use it.

```javascript
  watch:{
    name(latestValue){
      this.fullname=latestValue+'  '+ 'Watching'
    }
  }

```

Watcher keeps record of the new value and the old value of that variable being watched.
```javascript
  watch:{
    name(latestValue){
      this.fullname=latestValue+'  '+ 'Watching'
    }
    name(newValue, oldValue){
      this.tSum=latestValue+'  '+ 'Watching'
    }
  }

```

### Computed Properties better for multiple variable changes

The computed property is mostly best to observe changes of several other variables on one page. It is much better than the watcher since watchers observer individual variable this can 
give large amount of redundant code.

## Where watch shines
Watcher best shines when we work with specific variable or to observe it to some limit or observe it changes throughout the code.
The code below observes the value of counter and resets it to zero when the value of counter exceeds 100.

```javascript
 watch:{
    name(latestValue){
      this.fullname=latestValue+'  '+ 'Watching'
    },
    counter(latestValue){
      if(latestValue>100){
        this.counter=0
      }
    }

  },
```
