### Rendering List of Data


```html
    <section id="user-goals">
      <h2>My course goals</h2>
      <input type="text" v-model="goalItem"  @keydown.enter="updateUserGoals"/>
      <button>Add Goal</button>
<!--      <p :style="{display:showEmpty?'block':'none'}" v-if="goals.length<0">No goals have been added yet - please start adding some!</p>-->
      <p   v-if="goals.length<=0">No goals have been added yet - please start adding some!</p>
      <ul v-else>
<!--        <li v-for="goal  in goals"   v-if="goals.length>0">{{ goal }}</li>-->
        <li v-for="goal  in goals"   >{{ goal }}</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
```

also we can use the `of` format of the list looping,but preferable use the  `in`.
```html
 <li v-for="goal  of goals"   >{{ goal }}</li>
```

## Deep dive in v-for directives
We can also obtain more than just the item. we can also obtain the items index,

```html
  <li v-for="(goal,index)  in goals"   >{{index}} - {{ goal }}</li>
```
notice how we get the index. It is always a same the index is always going to be the second param in the brackets.

## Looping Objects
we can loop an object to obtain its values just like below.
```html
        <ul>
            <li v-for="value in {name: 'Fas',age: 31}"   >{{value}}</li>
        </ul>
```
Also we can get the key and value of the object

```html
   <ul>
       <li v-for="(value,key) in {name: 'Fas',age: 31}"   >{{key}}:  {{value}}</li>
  </ul>
```
if we needed it we can also get the index.
Personal observation is that vue objects are destructed in the opposite direction with value,key,index in that sequence.
```html
   <ul>
       <li v-for="(value,key,index) in {name: 'Fas',age: 31}"   >{{index}}-{{key}}:  {{value}}</li>
  </ul>
```
loops from 0 to number
```html
 <ul>
    <li v-for="num in 10 ">{{10 - (num-3)}}</li>
</ul>
```

## removing List item
We can do that by passing the index if the list item that is clicked to the function. so that we can remove that index from the list.

```html
<ul v-else>
        <li v-for="(index,goal)  in goals"  @click="removeGoal(index)"  >{{index}} - {{ goal }}</li>
</ul>
```
In this situation we can just remove the item at index with the splice method of arrays
```javascript
  removeGoal(idx){
      this.goals.splice(idx,1)
    }
```
this removes the item at that index from the list. 1 indicates the delete count. The delete count if increated would delete more elements as specified after that index.
If we indicate index as 5 and delete count as 3, it imples we ould delete 3 items after the index 5. 

## Event Propagations from Parent class
```html
      <ul v-else> 
        <li v-for="(index,goal)  in goals"  @click="removeGoal(index)"  >
            <p>{{index}} - {{ goal }}</p>
            <input type="text" @click.stop>
        </li>
      </ul>
```
The method `removeGoal(index)` is called anything a list item is clicked. so if anything appears between the list. then it gets the effect of that method being triggered.
We can stop this strange behavior by stopping the event trigger class from the parent. In our case  `@click.stop`. 
This implies the input item stops getting the effect of the event propagation on the list item.

But Notice when the `p` tag is clicked then the event click `removeGoal` would be fired.



## BIG STRANGE BUG-related to Performance

Vue in order to improve perfomance, when item of a dom is deleted, it does not delete all its content but moves the content of next item into the position of the first item.
This cause when even is fired, the item that fires the event is replaced with the next item on the list. so when input field of the first holds a value then deleting the first item
impplies the second item is just being replaced. This can cause previously entered values for other items to remain for others.
#### key attribute solves the problem.
 It is crucial to use the key identifier to helps us stop repeating the issue of items replacement.
The key bind helps solve the issue of data lost when working with list items. the key should be unique for all list items.
```html
    <li v-for="(index,goal)  in goals"  @click="removeGoal(index)" v-bind:key="index-goal"  >
            <p>{{index}} - {{ goal }}</p>
            <input type="text" @click.stop>
        </li>
      </ul>
```
