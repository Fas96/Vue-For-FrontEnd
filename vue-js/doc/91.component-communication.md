## Introduction to Props (Parent child communication)

In most common cases components created are created to be used in the parent component.
Parent components need to be able to listen to events from the child components.
In this, regards the props allows us to send or emit which event occured to the parent component.
## Props Definitions 
<a  id="prop-definitions"></a>
Props are defined as array and each prop for a component is writing in the list.
Each list item written in camel-case `phoneNumber`is much preferable and if not written properly can cause erorr in javascript `this.phone-number`.
```javascript
props:['name','phoneNumber','emailAddress']
```
In order cases we can define props as objects and also define the types and some properties for the props.
These are known as the[ props declarations and Validation](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.html).
```javascript
 props:{
    id:{
      type: String,
      require: true
    },
    name: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    },
    phoneNumber: {
      type:String,
      required: true
    },
    emailAddress: {
      type:String,
      require:true
    },
    isFavorite: {
      type: Boolean,
      require: false,
      default: false,
      validator(value) {
        return value===true || value=== false;
      }
    }
  }
```

And this props can be used in components just like data.
```html

<template>
  <div class="hello">
    <li >
      <h2>{{name}} {{isFavorite===true?'[orite]':'Less'}}</h2>
      <button @click="toggleDetails()"> {{detailsAreVisible?'Hide':'Show'}}  Details</button>
      <button @click="toggleFavorite()"> {{isFavorite ? true:false}}  Change</button>
      <ul v-if="detailsAreVisible">
        <li><strong>Phone:</strong> {{phoneNumber}}</li>
        <li><strong>Email:</strong> {{emailAddress}}</li>
      </ul>
      <button @click="deleteFriend">DeleteFriend</button>
    </li>
  </div>
</template>
```
### Props Communicating to Parent
In the component we cant to call the `deleteFriend` function when the button is clicked. But this needs to be able to send some 
data or communicate with the parent using `$emit`. 
```html
 <button @click="deleteFriend">DeleteFriend</button>
```
So, when this botton is clicked we sent the custom event `delete-friend` for the parent component to be able to use it to perform other events on the item.

```javascript
  deleteFriend(){
      this.$emit('delete-friend',this.id);
    }
```
In the parent component instance we can use the `delete-friend` on our component
```html
<friendComponent v-for="friend in friends" :key="friend.id" v-bind="friend" @toggle-favorite="toggleFavoriteStatus" @delete-friend="deleteThisFriend"></friendComponent>
```
This is pretty much like creating our custom events on the parent element that calls the component `FriendComponent` we created.


## Concepts of unidirectional Data Flow(One-Way Data Flow).
* Important Notice
When a Component prop is created  and passed to parent component, then this props value cannot be changed in the component by can ONLY be modified in the
parent component that is passing it the data.
### But if 
If there is a need to change this data in the child component then the child component should introduce a new data variable that reference the prop 
for modification.
```javascript
  data(){
    return {
      detailsAreVisible: false,
      friendIsFavorite: this.isFavorite 
    }
```
and here we can change the `isFavorite` prop passed by the component.
Notice this changes would not affect data in the parent Component.
```javascript
 toggleFavorite(){
      this.friendIsFavorite=!this.friendIsFavorite;
    },
```

## Dynamic Prop Values
Inititialy we just define our prop values directly.
```html
 <friendComponent name="Jenny"  phone-number="010-20000-4000" email-address="jenny.agency@naver.com" is-favorite="1"></friendComponent>
```
When we define props that can be of different values, this requires the dynamic concept of being able to use one option or the other like the  `v-if` or `v-show` or `v-bind`
In this regards we always want to set values for our props in the parent component like the dynamic javascript binding directives

```html
<friendComponent v-for="friend in friends" :id="friend.id"  :name="friend.name"  :phone-number="friend.phone" :email-address="friend.email" :is-favorite="friend.isFavorite" :key="friend.email" @toggle-favorite="toggleFavoriteStatus"></friendComponent>
```
The above definition gives us the change to alter the value of the data passed to the component. we can similarly pass our emitted custom actions.
Notice if the prop has an object similar with keys like the entity `friend` we are passing then we can simplify our repetitive definition for each prop.
` v-bind="friend"`, and always do not forget to add the `:key` for list items.
```html
 <friendComponent v-for="friend in friends" :key="friend.id" v-bind="friend" @toggle-favorite="toggleFavoriteStatus" @delete-friend="deleteThisFriend"></friendComponent>
```
Notice the given friend entity has same keys [as the defined props](#prop-definitions)
```javascript
 friends: [{id: uuidv4(),name: ' Big Data',phoneNumber: '01034 s34 991',emailAddress: 'bigdata@localhost.com',isFavorite: true}]
```


### Emitting Custom Events this.$emit('custom-event',...data)
Emit works just opposite like props. we communicate changes in parent component to child component about data changes or events.
The conversion is to always use events like this. `word-word`. That is different for props.
```javascript
this.$emit('delete-friend',this.id);
```
or 
```html
<button @click="$emit('deleteFriend')">click me</button>
```
The .once modifier is also supported on component event listeners:

```html
<friendComponent @delete-friend.once="callback" />
```

### Validating Custom Events
Emit also defines which events our component would eventually emit.
Emit can also be defined as object and validators for the emit can be defined.
This is done to document for other developers. It makes it easy to work with components.
we can define it as for simplicity.
```javascript
emits: ['toggle-favorite','delete-friend']
```
or we can just give object with function details.This makes it obvious for developers working with this defined event.

```javascript
  emits: {
    'toggle-favorite': function (id) {
      if(id){return true}else{console.log("Id is missing");return false;}

    },
    'delete-friend': function (id) {
      if(id){return true}else{console.log("Id is missing");return false;}

    }
  },
```
